	<h1>THE HURRICANES</h1>
	
	<p class="characterStory1">
		<span>One of the most destructive hurricane on record. Hurricane Ashley devastated many bars and taverns during "Cinco De Mayo" weekend, or as she inacurately called it: "El Cinco Del Drink-o: Mexican Independence Day, Bitches!", last year. The destruction escalated when Ashley was joined by 2 other high pressure system BFFs: Jessica and Kristy as they told the men that crossed their path that "men sucks" and instructed to "go f***" themselves. Experts believes that this is due to her recent drama with Scott. <br>
		<br>
		Now she's out for another night on the town after yet another drama caused by "that basic bitch, Kelly". Your mission is to lead Hurricane Ashley home ASAP before she can do any further damage.</span>
